# Awesome-LLM-Post-training-Papers
A curated list of papers and resources on post-training techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), including continual learning, instruction tuning, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), tool use, alignment, safety, and more.

Post-training plays a critical role in adapting pretrained LLMs to downstream tasks, improving their reasoning, alignment, and usability in real-world applications. This repository aims to provide a structured and up-to-date reference for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts in the field.
